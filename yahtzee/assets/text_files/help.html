    one or a two, it is still scored as 40 points.</p>
<h3>Alternative Scoring</h3>
<p>Large straights can also be scored in the small straight box, chance box, or in the numbers section.</p>
<h2><img src="asset:images/yahtzee.png" width="20" height="20"/> Yahtzee!</h2>

    following Yahtzee rolled earns you a bonus.</p>
<h2><img src="asset:images/chance.png" width="20" height="20"/> Chance</h2>
<p>Total of all five dice. This is a free for all box which can be used when you are unable to score in other categories
    and do not want to score a zero.</p>
<h2>Yahtzee Bonus</h2>
<p>After rolling one Yahtzee, the next Yahtzee earns you a 100-point bonus. Fill in one of the 13 boxes according to Joker Rules (described below). There is no limit
    to the amount of Yahtzee bonuses you can earn. However, if you have marked a zero in the Yahtzee box already, you
    can not earn Yahtzee bonuses. Fill in one of the 13 boxes in accordance with Joker Rules.</p>
<h2>Joker Rules</h2>
<p>Score the total of the five rolled dice in the right hand section. If those are filled, score in the left hand (numbers) section in
    accordance with point values defined above, i.e. Small Straight is 30 points.</p>
<p>Example of Joker Rules
<p>You roll five 5’s, but you have already marked zero in your Yahtzee box. You have also scored your 5’s in the numbers
    section as well, Joker Rules allow you to open any box in the right hand section for scoring that isn’t already occupied.
    For example, you may mark 40 in the Large Straight box if it is open.</p>
